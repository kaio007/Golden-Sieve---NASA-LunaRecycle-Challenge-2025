A Domain-Driven architecture for the autonomous manufacturing of Rad-Hard quantum sensors from lunar regolith. By utilizing Many-Body Localization (MBL) within an Al-Cu-Fe Quasicrystal framework, the GOLDEN-SIEVE transforms raw lunar elements into a self-healing, topological shield. This repository hosts the full-process simulation—from regolith extraction to Fibonacci-driven material reconstruction—providing a "blueprint" for resilient PNT hardware that survives the Moon by becoming part of its quantum landscape.

Project GOLDEN-SIEVE: Many-Body Localization via Fibonacci-Frequency Drives
This repository implements a 2D quasiperiodic lattice model (Al-Cu-Fe) to demonstrate sub-diffusive information protection in extreme environments.
Modularity: Decoupled Rust-based Hamiltonian engine and Three.js visualizer.
Key Physics: Diophantine Shielding against thermal avalanches and $50$ps jitter thresholds.
Creative Logic: Visualizes the "Splitting" of amorphous base metals and the "Recreation" of icosahedral quasicrystals through in-situ resource utilization (ISRU).
